Upgrader
========

Upgrader is a framework for automating the upgrade of code to handle API changes in dependent libraries.

Still under heavy development, in the first case it will provide a PoC of tooling to assist with SilverStriep 3 to 4 upgrades.

Developed by @sminnee with inspiration and encouragement from @camspiers
